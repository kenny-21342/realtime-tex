# Convergence contract

A background pass runs the instrumented full compile (`rtex-capture`) on a snapshot of the
buffers, repeating while the aux family changes or the log asks for a rerun, up to
`max_passes` (default 5). `biber`/`bibtex` run between passes when the document asks for them
(`.bcf` present or `\bibdata` in the aux; `bib_tool` selects the tool or disables this).

`LayoutUpdate.convergence`:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Converged` | aux family unchanged, no rerun request, no compile errors, and no edits since the snapshot |
| `Converging{pass, reasons}` | a further pass is needed (aux still changing) and will run |
| `PassLimitReached{passes, reasons}` | the run ended without converging: `max_passes` exhausted, or the aux family is stable but the log has errors (another pass over the same input would repeat them; a new run starts when an edit needs one or the host calls `request_layout`) — **never reported as converged** |
| `Stale{pending_since}` | edits arrived after the snapshot; another pass is already scheduled |

`LayoutUpdate.compile`:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Ok` | no errors in the log (warnings such as undefined references are reported as `Diagnostics`) |
| `CompiledWithErrors{count}` | pages were shipped but the log contains errors; the layout is partial output, not a converged layout |
| `Failed` | no page was produced; the previous layout stays current |

A missing bibliography tool makes the pass stop with `PassLimitReached` and a diagnostic.

`PdfExported.status` follows the same scale (`Ok` / `CompiledWithErrors` / `Failed`) and carries
`converged` (aux stable and no errors); only `converged = true` claims equality with a clean
LuaLaTeX build.

## Provisional layouts (slow multi-pass runs)

A run that needs several passes delivers each finished pass whose compile took 2 s or more as
a **provisional** `LayoutUpdate` (`convergence: Converging { pass, reasons: ["another pass is
running"] }`) while the next pass runs, then the final one as usual. On a TikZ-heavy document
(45 s per pass, three passes to converge) the host shows a usable layout after 45 s instead of
135 s. A provisional layout is a complete layout: placements, pages, contexts; only its
cross-references and page numbers may still move. Short runs (under 2 s per pass) deliver only
the final layout, as before.
