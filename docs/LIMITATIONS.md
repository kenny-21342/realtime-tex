# Limitations (rtex 0.0.2)

## What updates in real time, and what does not

"Real time" means the per-keystroke fast path (≈ 1 ms class): the edited paragraph is re-typeset
alone and its display list replaces it on screen immediately. Everything else is updated by the
background full compile, which takes as long as a LuaLaTeX run of the whole document (≈ 2 s for
10 pages, ≈ 5–15 s for 300 pages here, 2–3 passes when references change) and then arrives as a
`LayoutUpdate`. The host shows the edited source immediately in its editor pane either way; the
question is when the *typeset* view catches up. A layout after the first costs a body-only pass
in the standby engine (ARCHITECTURE.md), about a quarter of a full LuaLaTeX run.

| Content being edited | Typeset update | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Body text, font switches (`\emph`, `\textbf`, …), accents, colors, boxes (`\fbox`, `\parbox`, `\colorbox`, `\underline`, `\rule`), `\url`/`\href`/`\autoref` (hyperref), `\sout`/`\uline` (ulem), siunitx `\SI`/`\num`/`\si`, `\verb`, `\lstinline` | **real time** | fast path; package macros need their package loaded |
| Macros you define in the preamble (`\newcommand`, `\DeclareMathOperator`, parameterless `\def`) whose bodies use only allow-listed material | **real time** | trusted automatically, in text and/or math mode as their body classifies |
| Inline math `$…$` and display math `\[…\]`, `equation`, `align`, `gather`, `multline` (amsmath) from the allow-listed vocabulary, with `\label`/`\tag` and equation numbers | **real time** | paragraph unit; counters replayed |
| `\ref`, `\eqref`, `\pageref`, `\label`, plain and natbib `\cite`/`\citep`/`\citet`/`\citeauthor`/`\citeyear` | **real time** with the numbers of the last layout | labels and `\bibcite` from the last pass's aux, which the server also reads at `\begin{document}`; biblatex citations are background |
| Footnotes | mark in **real time**; the footnote text at the page bottom after the next pass | inserts are placed by the page builder (`reasons: inserts`) |
| Lists (`itemize`, `enumerate`, `description`, enumitem labels), `quote`/`quotation`/`verse`, `center`, `abstract`, theorem-like environments and `proof`, `verbatim`, `lstlisting`, setspace `spacing` | **real time** as one unit | environment unit; verbatim bodies are opaque to the allow-list |
| `subfigure`/`subtable` in a float, `tabularx`, `multirow`, colortbl/xcolor `\rowcolor`/`\cellcolor`/`\rowcolors` | **real time** inside their float or table unit | inner environments and table macros |
| `\setcounter`/`\addtocounter`/`\stepcounter`/`\refstepcounter` inside a paragraph or environment, hyperref `\texorpdfstring`, caption `\captionof` | **real time** | the server reports the counters a compile advanced and the session schedules a layout pass when that changes (what follows renumbers); a counter command *before* the unit's first text runs before its counters are captured and is background-only (`LeadingCounter`) |
| Environments defined in the preamble (`\newenvironment`/`\renewenvironment`) whose begin/end code is allow-listed | **real time** | one that opens a block environment (`quote`, a list, `center`, a theorem) is a unit of its own, like a theorem; otherwise it is typeset inside the paragraph that uses it. Code with `\def`/`\let`/`\global`, TikZ or other disallowed macros keeps the environment background-only |
| Setup after `\begin{document}`: `\newcommand`/`\def`/`\newenvironment`, `\setlength`, `\pagestyle`, `\lstset`, `\hypersetup`, `\definecolor` … on their own (no text in the span, and not inside an environment) | **loaded with the preamble** | the span draws nothing; the fast server executes these statements after the preamble, so macros defined in the body exist and are trusted like preamble macros. Editing such a span is a preamble change (engine restart). Macros redefined mid-document are additionally replayed per unit (row above), so position is honoured |
| Macros the body (re)defines (`\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}` before one table, `\def\H{4}` before a picture) | **real time, position-exact** | the capture scans the source for definitions, records each tracked macro's meaning per unit, and the server replays it (`macros` in the context); a setting changed mid-document applies from that point on, as in the pass |
| A heading directly after a paragraph's last line (no blank line), `\the<counter>` formats changed mid-document (`\appendix`, `\renewcommand{\thesection}`), user macros wrapping a heading (`\newcommand{\unnumberedsection}[1]{\section*{#1}…}`), LaTeX 2.09 font switches (`\rm`, `\bf`, `\it` in a group or in math), graphicx `\scalebox`/`\rotatebox`/`\resizebox` | **real time** | found on a 111-page physics notes document: the capture closes a paragraph unit only after the heading's own `\par`, running heads and feet built inside the output routine never join a unit, counter formats are captured per unit and replayed like counters |
| Title block (`\title`, `\author`, `\date`, `\thanks`, `\and`, `\maketitle`) in article/report without `titlepage` | **real time** | the capture's unit is the `center` environment the class builds; the server keeps the kernel macros usable between compiles and drops the page-level material around the block (its vertical glue comes from the placements). Classes with a title page and `\tableofcontents` stay background-only |
| biblatex citations (`\cite`, `\parencite`, `\textcite`, `\autocite`, `\footcite`, …) | **real time** | the server loads the last pass's `.bbl` next to its aux, so biblatex resolves citations as the layout did; `\printbibliography` is generated material (background) |
| Manual bibliographies (`thebibliography` with `\bibitem`/`\newblock`) | **real time** | one unit: the heading the environment prints and its items |
| Figures and tables (`figure`/`table` with `\includegraphics`, `tabular`, `booktabs` rules, `\caption`) | content in **real time** at the float's last position; a moved float after the next pass | float unit, float-box state replayed; placement is page-global |
| Headings (`\chapter`, `\section`, …) | **real time**; TOC and running heads after the next pass | heading unit |
| A unit that changes its row count (grows/shrinks) | unit in real time (rows placed with its own geometry); following material after the next pass | page breaks are global; `pagination_stale` says so |
| Several paragraphs in one source span (an explicit `\par`, a title line `{\Large\bfseries …\par}` followed by a text line) | **real time** as one unit | consecutive paragraph units of a span are merged into one composite unit |
| Splitting a paragraph (Enter + blank line), merging two, typing a new paragraph or block environment (a blank line before a `center`/`itemize`/`equation`, a new list) | **real time**: the known half keeps its context, the new unit borrows its neighbour's (counters may lag by one until the next pass) and is placed right after it | borrowed contexts are `context_stale`, placements `approximate`; a new float waits for the next pass |
| `tabularx` (with the package loaded) | **real time** | inner environment like `tabular` |
| TikZ/PGF diagrams, `\pdfliteral` drawing | background, and the page renders through the **PDF fallback**; in probe mode a `tikzpicture`/`circuitikz` unit is compiled live when it stays within the fast budget | not representable in the display list |
| Unchanged pictures, on a background pass or in a live unit (a sentence followed by a plot) | taken from an earlier pass's PDF (**picture cache**, `SessionConfig.picture_cache`, default on): a pass, or a live compile, costs the text, not the drawings; hosts render the picture from the PDF (`cached_picture` item) | a picture that mentions `\ref`/`\cite`/`\label`, counters, `\today`, `remember picture`, `overlay`, `\includegraphics`, `\input`, `\verb`, data files or group-escaping assignments (`\global`, `\xdef`, `\savebox`) is drawn every pass, as is one that spans lines or pages or whose `\begin` does not start its line |
| `\maketitle`, `\tableofcontents`, `\bibliography` | background | generated material (title block, TOC entries, bibliography) is not typed in place |
| `\marginpar`, `wrapfigure`, `\setlength`/`\renewcommand` at a unit's top level | background | would change the state the following units are typeset in (inside a group or environment they are fine) |
| Preamble, packages, macro definitions | background after an engine restart (≈ 1–2 s) | the server must reload the preamble |
| Macros you defined yourself whose bodies are not allow-listed (`\def` with parameters, TikZ, `\global` …) | background unless listed in `trusted_macros` | the allow-list cannot know they are pure |
| Any unit whose fast compiles exceed `fast_budget` (`fast_budget_ms`, default 5) three times in a row while no layout pass is running | background until the next layout | the real-time budget is enforced per unit; a unit's first slow compiles (font loading) are forgiven |
| A unit whose live compile hung (watchdog, 5 s) or crashed the engine | background until the preamble changes (`EngineFailed`) | retrying would kill the server on every keystroke; `rtex verify` on the project shows the engine error for that unit |

The fast server differs from a document run in two observable ways, both outside the unit box:
it inserts no running-head marks (`\markright`/`\markboth` keep only their `\nobreak`), and
package info messages (`\GenericInfo`, `\Gin@log`) do not reach its log. It also memoizes the
kernel's math font setup per size (ARCHITECTURE.md, "Server-only shortcuts"); a document that
redefines `\glb@settings` or `\Gin@getbase` gets the stock definitions, because every shortcut
checks the definition it replaces.

Every real-time item above is verified by `rtex verify`: the fast result of each eligible unit is
compared scaled-point-exact with the rows of the same unit on the shipped page
(`docs/FIDELITY.md`). Timings per unit kind are in `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`.

**Fast path scope.** Units built from the allow-list in `eligibility.rs` take the per-keystroke
path (see the table). Everything else — including any macro defined in the preamble unless the
host lists it in `trusted_macros`, and any environment not in the list — is typeset by the
background path and arrives with the next `LayoutUpdate` (seconds, not milliseconds). Text that
continues after a block environment inside the same span, and headings sharing a span with text,
are background-only (the capture closes the unit at the environment's end).

**Eligibility.** The table above lists what the allow-list knows. In the default *probe* mode
(docs/ELIGIBILITY.md) the allow-list is only the fast lane: any structurally sound unit is
eligible, and one whose vocabulary is not allow-listed is first proven by compiling its text as
the last pass typeset it and comparing the rows with the pass. What cannot be proven stays on
the background path for that layout (`unverified:` reasons on `BackgroundScheduled` and
`apply_edit`); a unit that leaks a global definition is demoted until the preamble changes.
The probe's blind spot is an edit that introduces a dependence the snapshot did not have
(typing `\thepage` into a verified paragraph on page 2): wrong until the next layout, which
re-probes.

**Documents.** The session tracks the main file and, transitively, every file it `\input`s,
`\include`s or `\subfile`s (loaded from disk at open and when a new `\input` line appears;
hosts hand over unsaved buffers with `set_document`). Paragraphs in those files are fast-path
units like any other; an edit to a file the preamble `\input`s is a preamble change (engine
restart). Files named through macros (`\input{\chapterdir/x}`), `\includeonly` and
`\import` are not followed.
LaTeX only (the paragraph hooks `para/begin` and `shipout/before` are LaTeX kernel hooks, 2021+).
LuaTeX only; no pdfTeX/XeTeX.

**Rendering.** Display lists name font files and glyph indices; hosts need an OpenType/TrueType
renderer. Type1 fonts (classic Computer Modern math without `unicode-math`) are named by file and
character code and must be rasterized by the host (the built-in verification rasterizer skips
them). Pages containing `\pdfliteral`/`\special` drawing, non-left-to-right text, `\vadjust`
material, unknown whatsits, unexpanded virtual-font commands or rows typeset inside a transformed
box (a pdflscape landscape table, a rotated `\parbox`: `transformed_rows`) or material added at
shipout (eso-pic backgrounds, pdfpages, watermarks: `shipout_extras`) are marked *Degraded*
and come with a PDF fallback path. TikZ/PGF pictures (literals and shadings) are drawn from the
display list's native drawing operations (docs/DISPLAY_LIST.md, "Native drawing"); tiling patterns
and soft masks still fall back to the PDF. A page's `/Rotate` (pdflscape) is reported as
`rotate`: hosts turn the page.

**Bibliographies and indices.** `biber`, `bibtex` and `makeindex` (default style, or a project
`.ist` through `-s`) run between background passes; `xindy` and `makeglossaries` do not (hook
point: `background.rs::run_pass_with_runner`). Glossaries printed without an external tool
(`\printnoidxglossaries`) need nothing.

**Determinism of exports.** Export equality with a clean build is byte-exact only when the
document suppresses optional PDF info (the fixtures set `\pdfvariable suppressoptionalinfo 1023`);
otherwise `rtex pdf-compare` ignores /ID, dates and producer and compares content streams, fonts
and images.

**Platforms.** Linux/macOS (FIFO transport). Windows named pipes are not implemented.

**Performance depends on the font stack.** With fontspec's default luaotfload node mode (and
more so with HarfBuzz), LuaTeX shapes every paragraph in Lua, which costs several times the
line-breaking time itself (docs/BENCHMARKS.md, E13). The 1 ms class is reached with TFM fonts
or OpenType fonts loaded with `Renderer=Basic`; node-mode documents still get paragraph-local,
document-size-independent updates, just slower per keystroke. Preamble changes restart the
engine (≈ 1–2 s with fontspec).
