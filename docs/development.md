# Working on rtex

## Repository layout

| Path | What is there |
|---|---|
| `crates/rtex-core` | the library: session, live engine, background passes, layouts, C ABI (`ffi.rs`) |
| `crates/rtex-dl` | the display-list model and its binary and JSON codecs |
| `crates/rtex-verify` | independent checks: PDF content-stream parser, rasterizer, PDF comparison |
| `crates/rtex-cli` | the `rtex` command: fixtures, verification, benchmarks, export, `serve` |
| `tex/` | the TeX and Lua side: live engine loop, capture package, node-list walk, picture cache |
| `tex/experiments/` | the LuaTeX experiments the design rests on ([engine-protocol.md](engine-protocol.md#facts-about-luatex-the-design-relies-on)) |
| `tex/tests/` | Lua unit tests (`texlua tex/tests/run.lua`) |
| `include/rtex.h`, `examples/c/` | C header (kept by hand, checked in CI) and a small C host |
| `fixtures/` | generated books, a corpus of realistic documents, research fixtures |
| `bench/` | benchmark TeX files, the paper's own benchmark (vendored), recorded results |
| `scripts/` | TeX Live installer, ABI check, release packaging |

## Releases

Publishing a GitHub release runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It builds `rtex` and the
shared library for five targets with the `dist` profile (stripped, thin LTO) and packages each
with `scripts/package.sh`. It smoke-tests the packages with `rtex doctor`, then attaches
`rtex-<target>.tar.gz` (or `.zip`) and a `SHA256SUMS` file to the release. The asset names have
no version, so `releases/latest/download/rtex-<target>.tar.gz` always points at the newest
build. To attach binaries to an existing release, run the workflow by hand ("Run workflow")
with its tag. Pushes that change the workflow or the package script run the builds without
publishing.

## Setting up

You need Rust (stable) and a TeX Live with LuaLaTeX and the packages the tests use. The
installer puts a minimal TeX Live into `build/texlive` without touching the rest of your
system. It takes about 15 minutes, and on Windows it runs from Git Bash.

```sh
scripts/install-texlive.sh
source build/texlive.env          # puts lualatex on PATH and sets RTEX_TEXLIVE_BIN
```

An existing full TeX Live (or MacTeX) works too: `export RTEX_TEXLIVE_BIN=/Library/TeX/texbin`.

## Building and testing

```sh
cargo build --workspace --release
cargo test --workspace --release     # unit tests, plus engine tests that need lualatex
texlua tex/tests/run.lua             # Lua tests
scripts/check-abi.sh                 # include/rtex.h matches the exported symbols (Linux, macOS)
cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --release -- -D warnings
```

Tests that need LuaLaTeX skip themselves when it is not found, so `cargo test` always works.
Run them in release mode: debug builds are slow enough to trip timing-sensitive tests.

The integration tests in `crates/rtex-core/tests/`:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `session.rs` | edits, splits and merges, stale results, probe mode, borrowed contexts, multi-file projects, counters, user environments, the title block |
| `units.rs` | every unit kind takes the live path; the time budget |
| `engine_robustness.rs` | errors, runaway loops, the watchdog, leaked definitions, large results, request order |
| `convergence.rs` | a converged layout equals a fresh run; the capture package does not change the PDF; biber and degraded pages |
| `bibliography.rs` | biblatex in a fresh session, makeindex and imakeidx, glossaries |
| `standby.rs` | the standby engine gives the same layout as a fresh run |
| `capture_groups.rs` | paragraphs that start inside a group |
| `piccache_live.rs` | cached pictures in the live engine |
| `internal_error.rs` | a Lua error inside the server is answered, not swallowed |
| `export.rs` | export equals a clean build; errors are reported |

## Fixtures and the `rtex` command

```sh
rtex gen-book --pages 100 --variant pure|mixed|units --fonts lm-tfm|pagella|pagella-base|pagella-harf|latin-modern --out DIR
rtex verify  --project DIR [--raster] [--permissive] [--pic-cache]   # see correctness.md
rtex edit    --project DIR --find "some text" --text " inserted"     # one edit through a session
rtex slice   --project DIR                                           # timing of one paragraph
rtex probe   --project DIR                                           # latency breakdown by stage and unit kind
rtex bench   --project DIR… --categories short,medium,…              # see benchmarks.md
python3 bench/compare/compare.py                                    # rtex vs Typst vs a full LaTeX run
rtex export  --project DIR --out out.pdf --check                     # export and compare with a clean build
rtex serve   --project DIR                                           # JSON-lines session
rtex doctor                                                          # is everything installed?
rtex pdf-compare A.pdf B.pdf
rtex dl2json FILE
```

`fixtures/corpus/` has realistic documents (homework, analysis notes, a report, a lab report, a
code document, a multi-file project, counters, a TikZ-heavy document). CI runs `rtex verify` on
each with a minimum number of live units. `fixtures/research/permissive/` holds constructs
outside the allow-list, used to check that probe mode catches every difference.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push:

| Job | Runs on | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `unit` | Ubuntu | format check, clippy, build, unit tests, ABI check, C example |
| `integration` | Ubuntu, cached TeX Live | Lua tests, all Rust tests, all verification layers on the fixtures, corpus, picture cache, probe mode, export equality |
| `platforms` | macOS, Windows, cached TeX Live | clippy, unit and integration tests, verification on one fixture, export equality |
| `perf` | Ubuntu, after integration | a quick benchmark; results uploaded as an artifact (hardware-dependent limits are warnings) |

## When the live engine fails

Set `debug_dir` (`SessionConfig::debug_dir`, C `"debug_dir"`, `rtex serve --debug-dir`, or the
`RTEX_DEBUG_DIR` environment variable). Every engine failure then leaves a folder
`engine-<time>-g<generation>-par<id>/` there, with:

- `report.json`: why (watchdog, state mismatch, crash, protocol error), the unit, versions;
- `source.tex`, `context.json`, `pics.json`: exactly what was sent;
- the server's driver, preamble copy and TeX log;
- `rtex-serve-g<generation>.trace`: one line per request stage and per font load, flushed
  immediately. A request that hung shows the last stage it reached, even though the killed
  process's log is cut off.

`requests.log` in the same directory gets one line per live compile: unit, status, rows, TeX
time and total time. With `RTEX_TRACE_MACROS=1` the server also runs with `\tracingmacros=1`.
That is much slower, so the watchdog is ten times longer while it is on.

A unit that hangs or crashes the engine is not tried again until the preamble changes. Without
that, every keystroke in it would kill the engine.

## Conventions

- Version: the library, C ABI, display-list format and engine protocol are versioned together
  as 0.0.x. Nothing is frozen before 0.1.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, …).
- A change to what the live engine produces needs `rtex verify` to stay exact on the fixtures
  and the corpus. CI enforces it.
